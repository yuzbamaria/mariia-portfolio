# Mariia Portfolio website

## Description
This is the solution for the challenge from EdX bootcamp, Week 2, Day 4. 
My task was to apply the skills I learned during the week (flexbox, grid, media queries, and CSS variables/selectors) and create my portfolio where I will showcase the projects I complete. While doing the project, I meet the following criteria: 

1. when the page is loaded, the page presents my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me;
2. when one of the links in the navigation is clicked, then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section;
3. when viewing the section about my work, then the section contains titled images of my applications;
4. when presented with the my first application, then that application's image should be larger in size than the others;
5. when images of the applications are clicked, then the user is taken to that deployed application;
6. when the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices, then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.
